    "1.\tWhat exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a list. We use square bracket to store data elements in a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tIn a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    " 9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators? \n",
    "+ and * respectively \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "With append method we append() the value at the last index whereas with insert() function  we can insert values at any desired index.\n",
    "\n",
    " 11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list? \n",
    "Remove() and pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical. \n",
    "List is a collection of heterogenous or homogenous data type elements and string is also a collection of characters. \n",
    "Both are iteratable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists? \n",
    "We use [] for assigining data elements in list and this is immutable whereas we use () for tuple and tuple is immutable i.e. we cannot change the values of tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42? \n",
    "tuple(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "We can use list() and tuple()\n",

    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain? \n",
    "Question is not clear\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    " \n",
    " copy.copy() generates a shallow copy. It is a actually refernece of oringinal object that is it copies the address of every data point. So change in copied object make change in original object.\n",
    " \n",
    " copy.deepcopy() assigns new address to every data elements through recursion. So any chane in copied object does not reflect in original object. \n",
