    "1.\tWhy are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions give reusability to the the code i.e. we can use same code for different input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWhen does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called? \n",
    "\n",
    "While calling the function\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function? \n",
    "\n",
    "def function_name(argument if any): \n",
    "\toperation \n",
    "\treturn \n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call? \n",
    "\n",
    "Function is a set of codes for specific problem statement and function call means we are calling that function to meet the requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Global scopes are those variable which are assigned globally which means they have the same value throughout that file. \n",
    "Local variable are assigned within the user defined function. So they have that value within that function only. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Return keyword in function yields the value of that variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Return keyword in function yields the value of the function. Yes we can have return value expression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "That function will not return any value. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable? \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to use global keyword with the local variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None? \n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot apply any operation on none datatype output. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do? \n",
    "\n",
    "It will import class areallyourpetsnamederic if exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obj = spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use exception handling technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause? \n",
    "\n",
    "Try keyword means we want to test this code and except keyword means we want to exclude that type of error if it appears. \n",
